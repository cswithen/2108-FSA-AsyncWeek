### Use these commands only if you fully understand what they do before you type them. The training wheels are off.

This is a "playground" repo. Fork it and clone it so you can use some of the things we went over in the lecture. There are nested directories and random files. See what you can find and change within the folders and the files. Run some commands! 

Only use the commands to get around and edit what you have cloned down. Avoid using any non-terminal editor like VSCode.

*Shells are all different so please use resource to find out what cammands work on your given machine. This lecture is written for Unix based systems, specifically I am running them on Mac OS. Differences will be seen in how to write the command, so look into them, especially if using Windows.
